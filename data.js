        <h5>Piece for Cartographies of Resistance, curated by Alina Sánchez for Lxs Invitadxs, Máxico Pavillion in Venice<br>
        Pulverized rock, E-Ink 2.3" screen, Arduino UNO R3</h5>
        <p>If the body is territory, how much of it is mine and how much belongs to my parents and ancestors? If part of it has been determined by my genetics and upbringing, how much of it is occupied, surrendered, given away, or in dispute?</p>
        <p>This piece is an attempt to connect with a part of this territory that is in dispute, where the imposed logic is that of devouring or allowing oneself to be devoured, much like the relationship between Cronus and his children, a bond formed through the father's fear of losing power. Cronus devours his children because he fears his own displacement. In the paintings of Rubens and Goya, we observe the contrast between the two bodies, and the apparent impossibility for the children not to eventually assume the position of the devoured.</p>
        <p>However, there is the possibility of deceiving the father to save oneself. Rhea, the mother of Zeus, finds a way to deceive Cronus: she wraps a stone in swaddling clothes so that the father mistakes it for the body of his child. Zeus later compels Cronus to regurgitate the children he had swallowed, starting with the stone.</p>
        <p>On the screen that I use for the piece, I write my own prayer that I also choose to take as a vow: <em>May your hunger never again be what takes my breath away.</em></p>

          <h5>Piece for Boxes made of gray paper lined with self-adhesive paper, cards of variable measurements written with a robotic plotter, and a table with self-adhesive paper.</h5>
          <p>Essay on a Ghosted Body is an essayistic device that consists of two boxes covered with basic meshes of faces for avatars on the Second Life platform and a table to read the essay in, covered with a pixellated digital skin texture. </p>
         <p>Inside the boxes there are two types of cards: on the smaller ones, functions of the body are inscribed (such as 'digest,' 'cry,' 'chew,' etc.). The larger cards contain various texts and fragments that explore the organic body confronted with its simulation: the avatar.</p>
        <p>I was inspired by the hours I had spent playing The Sims and making all my friends so we could do chores in virtual life (leaving unattended my actual chores). Avatars in general seem to me like concepts that I still want to explore because they hold many dimensions - they let us experiment with a body that feels no pain or lethargy, is not threatened by the outside world if they walk around. But they’re also embodiments of machines, examples of bodies that never get tired, and so they are perfect workers. </p>
        <p>I was inspired by John Suler’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230530071744/http://users.rider.edu/~suler/psycyber/psycyber.html" target="_blank">"Psychology of Cyberspace"</a>, one of the first academic hypertext books, written by Suler in 1996. He covers many psychological aspects of inhabiting the cyberspace, but I was particularly interested in his explorations of Worlds (a 3d virtual & open world, a precursor of Second Life & The Sims), avatars and how cyberspace is a lot like dreaming. </p>

          <p>Dreams of paradisiac summers, afternoons spent playing with water balloons and tie-dyes. Pamphlets filled with vacation spots, the image of an idyllic summer is long gone in the midst of a climate and political crisis. Still, there’s a footprint of that carefree happiness in our oneiric worlds, one that can extend into the concrete desire to build something that can hold that world again.</p>

          <h5>PROJECTION OVER WEAVED FABRIC, MOTION SENSOR, RASPBERRY PI, COPPER OBJECTS AND MDF</h5>
          <p>Ectoplasm is part of my explorations around corrupting the readability of texts to find a truth hidden behind words.</p>
         <p>It is a collaboration and dialogue with my mother and my grandmother. What is projected in the center of the canvas is a poem written by my grandmother. It is a poem that my mother has not wanted to hear. The phrase framing the poem is what my mom answered when I asked her: If you could say something to your mother right now, what would you?</p>
        <p>The piece consists of a projection of the poem onto two layered pieces of fabric in front of a candelabrum with a lit candle. When you attempt to approach and read the poem, the circle created by my mother's words gradually fills with green color, covering the words of my grandmother. </p>
        <p>I take the concept of ectoplasm, a resource used by mediums in the early 20th century during spiritualist nights to simulate the materialization of the spirit they wanted to contact for their clients. They would print faces on fabrics and pull them out from the mouth or vagina, as if these biological remnants of a deceased person first materialized within the body of the spiritualist before being expelled into the world.</p>

         <h5>PERFORMANCE WITH LIVE INTERACTION (SOCKET.JS, HTML & CSS) & LIVE MUSIC</h5>
         <p>This performance was an experiment in expanding a novel that did not want to be a novel, exploring the relationship between voice within the women of my family, including myself. It delves into the act of writing and the reluctance to finish or let go of this text, which transformed into a performance, a novel-score-ritual to engage in a dialogue with a manifesting darkness that desires to expand, speak, and be named.</p>
         <p>The performance involved giving instructions for attendees to read a text for each character and then destroy the text in various ways. As they read, their words were projected on the screen, triggering different reactions from the text simultaneously as the musician Granito provided synthesizer accompaniment. </p>
         <p>After the reading, attendees were required to interact with the pages they had used (e.g., sewing shut one of the scripts so it couldn't be read anymore, marking the pages with an X or burning the text).</p>
         <p>This was part of "Floresta Efímera," a cycle of digital literature focused on performative reading with new media curated by Canek Zapata.</p>
