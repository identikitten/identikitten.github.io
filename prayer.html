            <h5>Piece for Cartographies of Resistance, curated by Alina Sánchez for Lxs Invitadxs, Máxico Pavillion in Venice<br>
                Pulverized rock, E-Ink 2.3” screen, Arduino UNO R3</h5>
             <p>
                If the body is territory, how much of it is mine and how much belongs to my parents and ancestors? If part of it has been determined by my genetics and upbringing, how much of it is occupied, surrendered, given away, or in dispute?
            </p>
                <p>
                This piece is an attempt to connect with a part of this territory that is in dispute, where the imposed logic is that of devouring or allowing oneself to be devoured, much like the relationship between Cronus and his children, a bond formed through the father's fear of losing power. Cronus devours his children because he fears his own displacement. In the paintings of Rubens and Goya, we observe the contrast between the two bodies, and the apparent impossibility for the children not to eventually assume the position of the devoured.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                However, there is the possibility of deceiving the father to save oneself. Rhea, the mother of Zeus, finds a way to deceive Cronus: she wraps a stone in swaddling clothes so that the father mistakes it for the body of his child. Zeus later compels Cronus to regurgitate the children he had swallowed, starting with the stone.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                On the screen that I use for the piece, I write my own prayer that I also choose to take as a vow: <em>May your hunger never again be what takes my breath away.</em>
